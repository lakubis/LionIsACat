# Introduction
This is a project made by Felix and Leon. Here, we tried to explore how the settings of a battery-switching station (BSS) affects its specifications. To do that, we applied an agent-based model to observe the interaction between driver agents and the BSS agents. We looked into the performance of each settings by observing the survivability of the driver agents and the usage cycles of the batteries. This model was made using the [Mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library.

## The Model
The whole model is contained in [model_first_paper.py](https://github.com/lakubis/LionIsACat/blob/main/Felix_Learn/model_first_paper.py). More details coming soon (I hope!).
